## What is Comrad Cloud Data?

Comrad Cloud Data is a central cloud database used for distributing data to instances of [Comrad](https://github.com/codefordenver/Comrad). This repository contains scripts for managing a shared cloud database of data that is shared across all Comrad instances, such as: 
* scripts for generating data to seed the music library
* scripts for recording high-level information about what tracks are playing on each radio station
* scripts for calculating the popularity of each track/artist/album
* scripts for delivering the popularity of each track/artist/album to Comrad instances (used to improve search results in the music library)

The initial spec is [available in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XdzNaD9XJyMOimvEjzkN1DNjUINdj4p5).
